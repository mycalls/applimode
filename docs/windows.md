## Admin settings and custom_settings.dart
> [!NOTE]

> * If you change the **custom_settings.dart** file, you must rebuild it to apply it to your app.
<!--
> * When changing Admin settings, users fetch the values ​​on your app's first startup, and the values ​​are applied on your app's second startup.
> * The default minimum fetch interval for Admin settings is 600 seconds (10 minutes), and you can change it in the **custom_settings.dart** file.
-->

* The values ​​with **spare** in front of the name are ​​used when users first run your app after installing it. (when Admin settings are not yet activated). You can change them to whatever values you want.
> [!NOTE]
> * If you change a value in **Admin settings**, it is recommended to also change the corresponding spare value in the **custom_settings.dart** file.
> * For example, if you change the **App style** value, also change the **sparePostsListType** value in the **custom_settings.dart** file.
> * The **App style** values ​​in **Admin Settings** correspond to the **sparePostsListType** values ​​in the **custom_settings.dart** file as follows.
>   * **List style** - **PostsListType.small**
>   * **Card style** - **PostsListType.square**

## Configure Cloudflare R2 (Optional)

> * You can also use Cloudflare's CDN for free by registering a domain and connecting it with R2.
> * If you are building a video-centric app, I highly recommend using Cloudflare R2.
